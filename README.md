## Multiplication Table of Prime Numbers

### Version

[v1.0.1](https://github.com/TobyRet/prime_multiplication/releases/tag/1.0.1)

### Description

This is a programme that prints a multiplication table of prime numbers. The programme takes an argument from the command
line that specifies the amount of prime numbers to generate and prints out a multiplication table for these prime numbers.

### Run the programme

In the root of the application:

```
ruby run [amount_of_primes_to_generate]

```

### Known Issues

- I was not able to achieve the exact table formatting as specified in the problem description. 
I examined the table-terminal gem's source code and did not see an option to have a single vertical column.
